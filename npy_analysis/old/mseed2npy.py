'''
Functions in this module seperates any given mseed data into default 30 seconds waveforms, 
applies preprocessing, and saves it as .npy file 

ABOUT PRE-PROCESSING: 
We aimed to make our evaluation procedures compatiblewith the review article where arange of models have been compared on various datasets.

For this purpose, we chose the model input time window to be 30 seconds, applied bandpass filtering (1 âˆ’ 20Hz) 
and normalized the waveforms along the time axis to make the standard deviation of each channel equal to 1.
